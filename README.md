// here are examples of callbacks for user join and user leave.
// it can be used like Welcomer or Goodbye.

// callback
bot.onUserJoin()
bot.onUserLeave()

// code breakdown is in the docs...
// This command will run when someone joins the group
bot.userJoinCommand({
  groupJid: '123@g.us',
  code: `hello {user}, welcome to {group}`
})

// This will run when a user leaves the group.

  groupJid: '123@g.us',
  code: `goodbye {user} from {group}`
})
```
